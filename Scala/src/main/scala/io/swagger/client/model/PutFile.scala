 * @param commitSummary 
 * @param commitMessage  for example: '''Upload file using API'''
 * @param commitChoice  for example: '''direct'''
 * @param lastCommit If omitted, **only new files** will be accepted.     Otherwise, the request is accepted only if **the tip of the branch is the same as `last_commit`** at the moment of processing the request.  This is done to prevent accidental conflicting changes. To get the latest commit you can use the [branches API](#operations-Branches-getBranch)

 * @param versioning 
 * @param files This property can be sent multiple times to upload multiple files.
